### Continued development

It's my fourth challenge from FrontEnd mentor, but the first one which has an intermediate level of difficulty. Thanks to my practice on previous challenges, solving this one was easy. The hardest part, which took me one whole hour, was to produce the curved background because it has an elliptical shape at the bottom. However, when I tried to use Figma, it only took me 1 minute to make the background that I needed. Therefore, I plan to learn Figma, because I realized that it is a productive tool for FrontEnd development.
